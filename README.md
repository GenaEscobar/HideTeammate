# HideTeammate
**This is a paid plugin made by me, if you want to see more [click here](https://github.com/GenaEscobar/Gena-Private-Plugins)**

## Description:
This plugin hides your team so that it doesn't bother you when playing.
It has availability between FFA and TEAM modes, when FFA mode is activated this plugin does nothing, but when TEAMS mode is activated it hides your team.

**for admins:** They have availability on the !hideteam command to activate or deactivate the FFA mode (when the round is over) *the message that appears on the screen will only be for you*

**¿What will this allow?**
This will allow you to put more slots on your server since the map will not be saturated with people

**¿Can I use this plugin only in team mode?**
Yes, you can perfectly use this plugin in only one way

*This plugin was inspired by surfing, but can be used in different game modes*

**The change of cvar will be shown in the chat unless you put this command in your server.cfg: sv_logecho "0"**

## ¿What's different about it?:
What is different about this plugin is that the FFA or Teams mode can be activated automatically depending on the people who are playing or simply leave it manual.
